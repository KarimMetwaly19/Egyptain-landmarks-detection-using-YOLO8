        "Real-Time Considerations\n",
        "Speed: Real-time inference speed depends on your hardware (CPU/GPU). YOLOv8 is designed for real-time object detection, but running it on a high-resolution video feed might require a powerful GPU for smooth performance.\n",
        "Optimization: If real-time performance is critical, consider optimizing the model further, such as using a smaller model variant or deploying with a framework optimized for inference (like TensorRT for NVIDIA GPUs).\n",
        "Summary\n",
        "Loading from Pickle: Load the model’s weights from a pickle file and restore them into the model’s architecture.\n",
        "Real-Time Inference: You can use OpenCV to capture frames from a webcam and perform inference in real time, printing the detected labels on each frame.\n",
        "Performance: Ensure your system has enough computational power to handle real-time inference, especially if processing high-resolution images or videos.\n",
        "This approach allows you to leverage a saved YOLO model (via pickle) for real-time applications, such as live video analysis or interactive applications.\n",
